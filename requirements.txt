# PyTorch Requirements for Windows ARM64
# Note: PyTorch has limited ARM64 support. Consider these alternatives:

# Option 1: Use PyTorch Nightly (experimental ARM64 support)
# pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu

# Option 2: Use CPU emulation with x64 Python environment
# Install x64 Python and create x64 virtual environment instead

# Option 3: Use alternative ML libraries (uncomment if needed)
# numpy>=1.21.0
# scikit-learn>=1.0.0
# tensorflow>=2.10.0  # Has better ARM64 support

# Core dependencies that work on ARM64
numpy>=1.21.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
tqdm>=4.62.0
pandas>=1.3.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
ipykernel>=6.0.0

# YAML support
PyYAML>=6.0

# Optional: TensorFlow has better ARM64 support than PyTorch
# tensorflow>=2.10.0
